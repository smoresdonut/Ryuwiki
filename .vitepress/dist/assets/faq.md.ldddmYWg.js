The vast majority of the time, emulation is CPU-bottlenecked, as it mostly runs on CPU.</p><h3 id="•-game-runs-really-slow-for-me-what-can-i-do-to-increase-the-fps" tabindex="-1"><strong><strong>• Game runs really slow for me. What can I do to increase the FPS?</strong></strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-game-runs-really-slow-for-me-what-can-i-do-to-increase-the-fps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**__• Game runs really slow for me. What can I do to increase the FPS?__**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Make sure your graphics card drivers and Ryujinx are up to date.</p><p>If you have an AMD or Intel graphics card, you should always use the Vulkan backend instead of OpenGL. You may also dual boot Linux if you&#39;re still experiencing issues, as Mesa drivers are usually less buggy than AMD/Intel Windows drivers.</p><p>You may also be experiencing shader compilation stuttering (see the below answer), in which case, the more you play, the less of a problem it’ll be, as the shader cache will build up and the stutters will slowly go away.</p><p>If your game is still slow, you might need to get a better PC or wait for emulator optimizations.</p><h3 id="•-what-are-shaders-and-why-do-i-need-them" tabindex="-1"><strong><strong>• What are shaders and why do I need them?</strong></strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-what-are-shaders-and-why-do-i-need-them" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**__• What are shaders and why do I need them?__**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Shaders are small programs used in videogame rendering. In modern emulation (and even some PC games), every time a new model or effect shows up on screen, its shader needs to be compiled (read: translated) for your GPU. While the shader is being compiled, the game needs to pause, which you will know as shader compilation stuttering. Once the shader has been compiled, it gets stored in a shader cache, which will ensure you don’t stutter the next time that shader comes up.</p><p>Unfortunately, shader compilation is not easy to circumvent. Vulkan is significantly faster at shader compilation than OpenGL thanks to SPIR-V, Vulkan&#39;s shader backend. On first runs we recommend letting games play out opening cutscenes and then restarting, or running anything that makes them play themselves, such as automatic racing in MK8 or bot matches in SSBU. This will compile some shaders and, with a fast enough CPU and Vulkan, the hiccups will be greatly reduced.</p><h3 id="•-how-do-i-enable-asynchronous-shader-compilation-async-shaders" tabindex="-1"><strong><strong>• How do I enable asynchronous shader compilation/async shaders?</strong></strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-how-do-i-enable-asynchronous-shader-compilation-async-shaders" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**__• How do I enable asynchronous shader compilation/async shaders?__**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Asynchronous shader compilation introduces graphical glitches, which sometimes don’t go away until a restart, and does not actually eliminate stuttering completely; as such, the Ryujinx developers have no plans to implement this feature. However, outside contributors are welcome to write and open a pull request for it, and it will be reviewed, approved and added to the main builds if it&#39;s up to Ryujinx standards.</p><h3 id="•-why-is-my-game-30fps" tabindex="-1"><strong><strong>• Why is my game 30fps?</strong></strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-why-is-my-game-30fps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**__• Why is my game 30fps?__**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Because the game you&#39;re playing is a 30fps game.</p><h3 id="•-how-do-i-uncap-the-framerate" tabindex="-1"><strong><strong>• How do I uncap the framerate?</strong></strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-how-do-i-uncap-the-framerate" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**__• How do I uncap the framerate?__**&quot;">​</a></h3><p><code>F1</code> uncaps fps, or <code>Tab</code> if you have an older install.

How do I make it normal speed?__**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The vast majority of Nintendo Switch games have their physics and speed tied to the framerate, and as such, increasing the framerate increases the game speed. In these cases, you need to find a 60fps mod (or whatever target you want; some 120fps mods exist) for your specific game.</p><p>You also have to keep in mind that these mods may be static, which means going under the target may cause the game to run in slow motion. If your hardware can’t run a game at that target, you will be better off not using framerate mods.</p><h3 id="•-how-do-i-install-mods-for-a-game" tabindex="-1"><strong><strong>• How do I install mods for a game?</strong></strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-how-do-i-install-mods-for-a-game" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**__• How do I install mods for a game?__**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Right click the game &gt; <code>Manage Mods</code>.

This includes shader compilation stuttering, so every player will have to play through every track in single player mode first, in order to cache shaders, and also ensure that they can maintain 60fps on every stage. Remember to keep Vsync enabled as well, since it acts as a framelimiter.</p><h3 id="•-i-m-playing-with-a-friend-and-why-is-it-so-laggy" tabindex="-1"><strong><strong>• I’m playing with a friend and why is it so laggy?</strong></strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-i-m-playing-with-a-friend-and-why-is-it-so-laggy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**__• I’m playing with a friend and why is it so laggy?__**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Real world distance still applies, so if you’re in different continents or just really far away from each other on the Earth, then you will have the corresponding latency.</p><p>It can also be that a P2P connection was not formed and you’re connecting via the master server, which will of course increase latency as well. If this is happening, you can try connecting using ldn_mitm in conjunction with either XLink Kai or a VPN like Zerotier, which would allow you to connect to each other directly.</p><p>If you’re playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the game has latency baked into it and pretty bad netcode.

This includes software which puts an overlay on top of the emulator display window, like the MSI Afterburner overlay or Twitch Studio.</p><h3 id="•-black-screen-with-sound-on-nvidia" tabindex="-1">• Black screen with sound on Nvidia: <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-black-screen-with-sound-on-nvidia" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;• Black screen with sound on Nvidia:&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Restore your Nvidia control panel global settings to defaults.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79612681/232948458-2f290f24-b27d-4b12-8170-039a32743030.png" alt="image8"></p><h3 id="•-ryujinx-window-is-transparent-see-through" tabindex="-1">• Ryujinx window is transparent/see-through: <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-ryujinx-window-is-transparent-see-through" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;• Ryujinx window is transparent/see-through:&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Disable sharpening under global graphics in the Radeon control panel.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79612681/232948514-1df76fe2-9340-40ad-9cae-c84bffb60181.png" alt="image"></p><h3 id="•-emulator-window-hanging-not-responding-after-exiting-a-game" tabindex="-1">• Emulator window hanging/not responding after exiting a game: <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-emulator-window-hanging-not-responding-after-exiting-a-game" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;• Emulator window hanging/not responding after exiting a game:&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Close the console window, it will also close the other one.

Check that your resolution scaling isn’t too high; 4x is overkill for virtually every setup.</p><p>If you’re playing Astral Chain, Bayonetta 3, Fire Emblem Engage, Metroid Prime Remastered, Super Mario Bros. Wonder or The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, you might need to enable texture recompression in graphics settings. This is because these games use ASTC textures, which are supported natively without needing to be decompressed on the Switch, but when decompressed on PC can become massive and take up a lot of VRAM.</p><p>If you’re playing other games and your resolution is on native, it might be an issue with emulating that particular game.</p><h3 id="•-game-crashes-with-e-gui-renderloop-application-unhandled-exception-caught-ryujinx-graphics-vulkan-vulkanexception-unexpected-api-error-errordevicelost" tabindex="-1">• Game crashes with <code>|E| GUI.RenderLoop Application : Unhandled exception caught: Ryujinx.Graphics.Vulkan.VulkanException: Unexpected API error &quot;ErrorDeviceLost&quot;.</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-game-crashes-with-e-gui-renderloop-application-unhandled-exception-caught-ryujinx-graphics-vulkan-vulkanexception-unexpected-api-error-errordevicelost" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;• Game crashes with `|E| GUI.RenderLoop Application : Unhandled exception caught: Ryujinx.Graphics.Vulkan.VulkanException: Unexpected API error &quot;ErrorDeviceLost&quot;.`&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is a generic Vulkan crash. There’s hardly any information that can be gleaned from it, and the solutions vary wildly from case to case, but most of the time it’s not something users can fix or workaround.</p><p>On Nvidia, some device loss crashes were introduced in driver version <strong>527.37</strong> (not just in emulated games; native PC games too) and, at time of writing, it seems drivers newer than this still have some problems. If you are on newer Nvidia drivers and can’t find any mention of these crashes in the compatibility list for your game, it might be worth downgrading the driver version.</p><p>On AMD and Intel GPUs, a bigger amount of games have this issue. If updating to the latest drivers doesn’t fix it, your best bet will be Linux and Mesa drivers.</p><h3 id="•-game-crashing-with-e-hle-guestthread-19-application-unhandled-exception-caught-ryujinx-hle-exceptions-guestbrokeexecutionexception-the-guest-program-broke-execution-at-ryujinx-hle-hos-kernel-supervisorcall-syscall-break-uint64-reason-in-d-a-ryujinx-ryujinx-ryujinx-hle-hos-kernel-supervisorcall-syscall-cs-line-1873" tabindex="-1">• Game crashing with <code>|E| HLE.GuestThread.19 Application : Unhandled exception caught: Ryujinx.HLE.Exceptions.GuestBrokeExecutionException: The guest program broke execution! at Ryujinx.HLE.HOS.Kernel.SupervisorCall.Syscall.Break(UInt64 reason) in D:\\a\\Ryujinx\\Ryujinx\\Ryujinx.HLE\\HOS\\Kernel\\SupervisorCall\\Syscall.cs:line 1873</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#•-game-crashing-with-e-hle-guestthread-19-application-unhandled-exception-caught-ryujinx-hle-exceptions-guestbrokeexecutionexception-the-guest-program-broke-execution-at-ryujinx-hle-hos-kernel-supervisorcall-syscall-break-uint64-reason-in-d-a-ryujinx-ryujinx-ryujinx-hle-hos-kernel-supervisorcall-syscall-cs-line-1873" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;• Game crashing with `|E| HLE.GuestThread.19 Application : Unhandled exception caught: Ryujinx.HLE.Exceptions.GuestBrokeExecutionException: The guest program broke execution!   at Ryujinx.HLE.HOS.Kernel.SupervisorCall.Syscall.Break(UInt64 reason) in D:\\a\\Ryujinx\\Ryujinx\\Ryujinx.HLE\\HOS\\Kernel\\SupervisorCall\\Syscall.cs:line 1873`&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This means the game itself crashed, and not the emulator.

There can be many of these as well, but we’ll cover the most common.</p><ul><li><p><code>ResultFsPermissionDenied (2002-6400)</code> here usually means Ryujinx has been denied access to the save folder for this game. Most of the time it’s solved if you delete the save folder: Right click the game &gt; <code>Open User Save Directory</code>. Backup the contents if you care about the save. Go up 2 levels and delete the selected folder. Run the game again.</p><ul><li>If this doesn’t fix it, check that Ryujinx isn’t on a protected folder (such as the desktop or the root of a drive) and that a third party antivirus (if you have one) isn’t blocking Ryujinx from using the save folder. If all else fails, make a portable install and bring over your caches and saves from the previous install.</li></ul></li><li><p><code>ResultFsTargetNotFound (2002-1002)</code> might have the same causes and solutions as those described above.</p></li><li><p><code>ResultKvdbInvalidKeyValue (2020-0005)</code>, also similar to the 2 above errors, means the savedata index for the game isn’t found, so the savedata is corrupted. Try backing up and then deleting the game&#39;s savedata folders. If this doesn&#39;t solve it, backup your whole Ryujinx data folder (<code>C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ryujinx</code>, or the portable folder if you&#39;ve made a <a href="https://github.com/GreemDev/Ryujinx/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#-whats-a-portable-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">portable install</a>) and then delete it. Then restore the subfolders (caches, save files) you&#39;d like to keep.</p></li><li><p><code>ResultFsOutOfRange (2002-3005)</code> usually indicates a bad dump (corrupt game files). If FS integrity checks is disabled and you are getting this error, enable it, run the game again and check if you now get a hash error as described <a href="https://github.com/GreemDev/Ryujinx/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#-crashing-after-booting-a-game-or-crashing-after-applying-an-update-with-e-hleosthread8-application--unhandled-exception-caught-systemreflectiontargetinvocationexception-exception-has-been-thrown-by-the-target-of-an-invocation-----libhaccommonhorizonresultexception-resultfsnonrealdataverificationfailed-2002-4604-hash-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p></li><li><p><code>ResultErrApplicationAborted (2162-0001)</code> is as generic as it gets.

In the future, when ASTC texture decoding and shader compilation are improved, it may be possible to minimize the stutters to a point where they’re not noticeable on a fast enough CPU. Currently, the only solution is to watch the cutscenes elsewhere or try to resync the video via speeding it up by toggling Vsync.</p></li></ul><h3 id="bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon" tabindex="-1">Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon <a class="header-anchor" href="#bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Flickering square artifacts: it’s a driver issue on Nvidia RTX 3000/4000 graphics cards and on drivers newer than 522.25.
